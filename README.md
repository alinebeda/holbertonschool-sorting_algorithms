# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Requirements

.	Used editor : vi
.	All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 
.	Code must follow the Betty style
.	Global variables are not allowed
.	No more than 5 functions per file
.	All prototypes for functions should be included in the header file sort.h

## Compilation

The line of code we use to compile:
```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
```
### Tasks

In this section, we will look at some sorting algorithms wrote in C.

The sorting algorithms are:
- **Bubble sort**
- **Insertion sort**
- **Selection sort**
- **Quick sort**
